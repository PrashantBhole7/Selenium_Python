# Approach 1:
# my_list = [10, 34, 23, 12, 18]
# total = 0
# for i in range(0, len(my_list)):
#     total = total + my_list[i]
# print("Sum of all the elements of list is :", total)

# Approach 2 : using sum() method
my_list = [10, 34, 23, 12, 19]
print("Sum of all the elements of list is :", sum(my_list))
